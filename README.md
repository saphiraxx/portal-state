# Portal State App ✨

Welcome to **my very first React Native experiment**!  
This app is small, but like Rick Sanchez says:

 *“Sometimes science is more art than science, Morty. A lot of it is about having fun.”*

## What This App Does 📱

- Starts with a background image (`developapp.png`)  
- Shows a button: **“Click Here”**.  
- When you click the button:  
  - The image flips to `rick.png`.  
  - The button disappears.
